    "1. Initialize `group_id` as `m`. Iterate over each item `i`, if it doesn't belong to a group, assign unique group id `group_id` and increment `group_id` by 1.\n",
    "2. Create adjacency map `item_graph` for all items and `group_graph` for all groups. Also create indegree list `item_indegree` and `group_indegree`.\n",
    "3. Traverse `before_items`, add dependency pairs `(prev, cur)` into `item_graph`, increment indegree `cur` by 1. If items belong to different groups `group[prev]` and `group[cur]`, add group dependency to `group_graph` and increment indegree of `group[cur]` by 1\n",
    "4. Perfrom topological sort of items according to `item_graph` and `item_indegree`. If there is cycle, task is impossible.\n",
    "5. Perform topological sort of groups based on `group_graph` and `group_indegree`. If there is cycle, task is impossible.\n",
    "6. Create empty list `answer` to store final order and hash map `ordered_groups` to store sorted items within each group.\n",
    "7. Iterate over sorted items, for each item `i`, add it to `ordered_groups` while preserving original order within group: `ordered_groups[group[i]].append(i)`\n",
    "8. Traverse sorted groups, for each group `group_idx`, add all items items `order_groups[group_index]` to `answer` while maintaining original order"
